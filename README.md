# Mastermind Game 🎯

A simple Python implementation of the classic code-breaking game **Mastermind**.

## 🧠 What is Mastermind?

Mastermind is a logic-based game where a player tries to guess a secret code within a limited number of attempts. After each guess, feedback is provided to guide the player—typically in the form of how many digits/colors are correct and in the right position.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

- `mastermind.py` – The main Python script containing the game logic.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Clone the repository or download the `mastermind.py` file.
3. Run the script in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python mastermind.py

🎮 Features
•Customizable code length and number of attempts
•Feedback after each guess (e.g., correct position and value)
•Clean, readable code with comments
•Terminal/console-based interface

📌 Example Output
Welcome to Mastermind!
I have chosen a 4-digit code. Can you guess it?
Enter your guess: 1234
Result: 2 correct digits in the right place, 1 correct but in the wrong place.
